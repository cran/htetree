Description: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects with tree-based machine
    learning algorithms and visualizing estimated results in flexible and 
    presentation-ready ways. For more information, see Brand, Xu, Koch, 
    and Geraldo (2021) <doi:10.1177/0081175021993503>. Our current package 
    first started as a fork of the 'causalTree' package on 'GitHub' and we 
    greatly appreciate the authors for their extremely useful and free package.
